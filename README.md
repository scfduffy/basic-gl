Just a repository of basic GL running with asdf-keyboard navigation.
I have two fully working half engines on a hard disk I cant access at the moment. The first of which is an interpolating model animator for drawing real time humans engaged in walking, running, etc. The second of which is a buggy virtual reality physics engine which draws using OpenGL according to the specifications of the real time physics engine written in C++. The idea was to fix the bugs on the physics engine then combine the model animator to create a full engine but unfortunately work commitments caused me to stop developing the engine and I dont currently have access to a Desktop with SATA  to access the hard disk so these are early attempts at reconstructing things.
